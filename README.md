# SwapfietsAssignment

### Features

The assessment is split - up into two folders:
- Task3_APICollection
- Task4_FeAutomation

## Task3_APICollection

Please download and import the Swapfiets collection directly into Postman. 

The API requests can be executed manually, however please use the Postman "Collection Runner". The Collection Runner enables you to run a collection's requests in a specified sequence. It logs your request test results and can use scripts to pass data between requests and alter the request workflow. The scripts have been setup in such a way that during executions, collections variables, will be set and unset until the scripts completes.
